            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
              Takashi Amano, born in Niigata, Japan in 1954, was a celebrated landscape photographer and aquarist. Since 1975, Amano has travelled to various parts of the globe such as the tropical rainforests of the Amazons, Borneo and West Africa, and the lush forests of Japan. During his visits, he has created a series of photos that emphasize on the focus of "untouched nature" using his large-format cameras.

            <p>
              Through his photography, Amano has developed a unique style called "Nature Aquarium" where he aquascapes tanks by incorporating ecosystems and other aspects of nature into the scape. In 1982, he created the company Aqua Design Amano (ADA), which became well-known for their excellent quality and design of their aquarium products.

              In recent years, Amano has given numerous lectures on his rich experiences in nature in Japan and many other countries, including Germany, Italy, Portugal, Poland, Russia, USA, China, India and Malaysia, and he has advocated the importance of tree-planting programs to protect the Earth's environment.
